## TADLAB

This is my final project for the Flatiron School Software Engineering program that I finished in February of 2022.

In it's current state, the application is not fully functional and serves more as a proof of concept for future projects. 

In previous projects, I would mainly focus on functionality and leave the styling for the end only to run out of time.

For this project, I put a heavy emphasis on styling in order to learn more about CSS and improve the user experience.

Dependencies:

reduxjs/toolkit ^1.9.2
react-redux ^8.0.5
node >= 16.17.0
tonejs ^4.14.0
ruby 3.0.5
rails ~>6.1.7

To run:

It's best not to try at this time, the project has been split into 3 branches, one for a Ruby backend, one for the project itself, and the original Python backend.

Instead, enjoy this GIF of a demo below!

In the future there will be projects to properly demonstrate all of the functionality.

DEMO:

The demo does generte sound, but the gif below does not.
