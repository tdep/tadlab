## TADLAB

This is my final project for the Flatiron School Software Engineering program that I finished in February of 2022.

In it's current state, the application is not fully functional and serves more as a proof of concept for future projects. 

In previous projects, I would mainly focus on functionality and leave the styling for the end only to run out of time.

For this project, I put a heavy emphasis on styling in order to learn more about CSS and improve the user experience.

Dependencies:

- reduxjs/toolkit ^1.9.2
- react-redux ^8.0.5
- node >= 16.17.0
- tonejs ^4.14.0
- ruby 3.0.5
- rails ~>6.1.7

To run:

In `./server` run `rails s`

Then in `user-interface` run `npm ci run dev`

Finally, navigate to localhost:5173/tadlabmini in your browser and have fun!

You will need to 'turn on' the unit and then 'turn-on' Oscillator-1 in order for sound to come out.

It may also glitch and a note might get stuck, but just ctrl-r if that happens and voila!


Or, enjoy this GIF of a demo below!

In the future there will be projects to properly demonstrate all of the functionality.

DEMO:

The demo does generte sound, but the gif below does not.
